# ARFF Toolkit

This package is a WIP for a machine learning class.

This isn't really intended for public use yet (if it ever reaches that point), hence the version number < 1.

## Terminology

  * patterns: input set, all input rows, entire input matrix.
  * pattern: a single combination of inputs, a row in the patterns matrix.
  * targets: labels, the desired outcomes. Ordering must match the patterns matrix.
